# Machine-Learning-Model-8
**Using a pipeline explore, clean, and preprocess data for machine learning capabilities**

* Research the domain of the dataset.
* Perform EDA on the dataset.
* Clean as much of the data as possible.
* Perform preprocessing techniques where applicable.
* Test at least three models for each of the regression and classification.
* Tune each model and select the best one.
* Apply the concept of pipelines to the best model.
